# UI V2
Currently, it will directly use the npm module skydive-ui. If you want to manully use other source, you need disable
.mk/ui.mk
```
#      cd statics/ui_v2 && npm install && npm run prepare && cd -
```
Web source file, you can refer to skydive-ui/dist folder. Manully copy it to statics/ui_v2.

# Skydive

Skydive is an open source real-time network topology and protocols analyzer.
It aims to provide a comprehensive way of understanding what is happening in
the network infrastructure.

Skydive agents collect topology information and flows and forward them to a
central agent for further analysis. All the information is stored in an
Elasticsearch database.

Skydive is SDN-agnostic but provides SDN drivers in order to enhance the
topology and flows information.

## Key features

* Captures network topology and flows
* Full history of network topology and flows
* Distributed
* Ability to follow a flow along a path in the topology
* Supports VMs and Containers infrastructure
* Unified query language for topology and flows (Gremlin)
* Web and command line interfaces
* REST API
* Easy to deploy (standalone executable)
* Connectors to OpenStack, Docker, OpenContrail, Kubernetes

## Quick start

### All-in-one

The easiest way to get started is to download the latest binary and to run it using the `all-in-one` mode :

```console
curl -Lo - https://github.com/skydive-project/skydive-binaries/raw/jenkins-builds/skydive-latest.gz | gzip -d > skydive && chmod +x skydive && sudo mv skydive /usr/local/bin/

SKYDIVE_ETCD_DATA_DIR=/tmp SKYDIVE_ANALYZER_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:8082 sudo -E /usr/local/bin/skydive allinone
```

Open a browser to http://localhost:8082 to access the analyzer Web UI.

### Helm

If you are using Kubernetes then you can deploy skydive using helm directly from Git:

```console
helm plugin install https://github.com/aslafy-z/helm-git --version 0.10.0
helm repo add skydive git+https://github.com/skydive-project/skydive@contrib/charts
helm repo update
helm install skydive-analyzer skydive/skydive-analyzer
helm install skydive-agent skydive/skydive-agent
kubectl port-forward service/skydive-analyzer 8082:8082
```

Open a browser to http://localhost:8082 to access the analyzer Web UI.

### Docker

```console
docker run -d --privileged --pid=host --net=host -p 8082:8082 -p 8081:8081 \
    -e SKYDIVE_ANALYZER_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:8082 \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /run/netns:/var/run/netns \
    skydive/skydive allinone
```

Open a browser to http://localhost:8082 to access the analyzer Web UI.

### Docker Compose

To quick set up a more complete working environment (with history support), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
can be used to automatically start an Elasticsearch container, a Skydive analyzer
container and a Skydive agent container.

```console
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skydive-project/skydive/master/contrib/docker/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
```

You can also use the Skydive [command line client](https://skydive-project.github.io/skydive/getting-started/client/) with:
```console
docker run --net=host -ti skydive/skydive client query "g.V()"
```

Open a browser to http://localhost:8082 to access the analyzer Web UI.
